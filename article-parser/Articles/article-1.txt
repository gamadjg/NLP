Tacos are some of the best forms of food. They are simple, meat wrapped in a tortilla, with some toppings on it. To me it comes down to fundamentals, because the taco is simple it forces cooks to really know what they are doing with no frills. One's ability to cook the tortilla, the meat, which toppings to choose, every little thing counts.
